SAYALERT=false     # Announce new alerts as they are detected
SAYALLCLEAR=true   # Announce when all alerts are cleared
# Example: a system has a WX alert radio that decodes SAME/EAS data from the
# NWS via RF and does not need AutoSkyMulti to announce new alerts, however we
# still want to use the tailmessage and all-clear message from AutoSkyMulti.

BLOCKING=false # Enable blocking of certian alerts in AutoSkyMulti

# If you want to play messages to multiple
# nodes on the same host system, place them space-separated in the NODE
# variable, like:
# NODE="xxxxx1 xxxxx2 xxxxx3 xxxxx4"
NODE=1117

# Ability to change courtesy tones automatically when certian WX alerts are active.
# Must correctly setup CTs in rpt.conf for this to work. All files used must
# be 8K RAW ULAW audio files. Set tone generation amplitude to 0.25 in Audacity.
# Place audio files defined below in the directory defined for $CTDIR.
# Edit which alerts trigger this function in the AutoSkyMulti script.
# Example rpt.conf:

ASTLINKCT="ct-link.ulaw"        # Normal LINK CT file
